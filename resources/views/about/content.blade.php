    <h2>Burt Gummer Appreciation Society</h2>
    <p>"Doomsday Prepper"? We think not. Burt Gummer is a <br>
        virile man, with a bold mustache and attire that says, <br>
        "Yeah, I've been there. Yeah, I've done that.", and <br>
        if he hasn't, he will. Gummer is a man who is bent <br>
        on survival at all costs, no matter how old he gets, <br>
        he's going to survive all these damn movies. Burt Gummer <br>
        the first to destroy a Graboid, the first to show other men the <br>
        rules of the road. It's for this reason we follow him. <br>
        It's for this reason we praise him.</p>
